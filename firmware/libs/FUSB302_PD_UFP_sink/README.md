# FUSB302 PD UFP sink
Arduino library for the FUSB302 USB power delivery controller IC.<br/>
This library is based on the excellent work of Ryan Ma in his PD_Micro repository: https://github.com/ryan-ma/PD_Micro/tree/master<br/>
Only operation as UFP sink is supported. USB power delivery 3.0 including PPS is supported.<br/>
<br/>
This library requires ~7kB of flash and ~310Bytes of SRAM on an AVR based board.
